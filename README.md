# LonelyPlanets
AMUSE scripts for integrating planetary systems in a stellar cluster
Written by Simon Portegies Zwart (Leiden, 2023)

The idea of LonelyPlanets is based on the manuscript Cai, M.X.,
Portegies Zwart, S.F., Kouwenhoven, M.B., Spurzem, R., 2019, MNRAS
489, 4311 (2019MNRAS.489.4311C), On the survivability of planets in
young massive clusters and its implication of planet orbital
architectures in globular clusters.

Here we present an independent implementation which works on any
N-body integrators and stellar evolution code in AMUSE, and the effect
of the Galactic tidal field is included.

The LonelyPlanets script can be used in conjunction with any of the
N-body codes and stellar evolution codes implemented in AMUSE, it
includes stellar evolution, collisions, and a semi-analytic Galactic
potential.
